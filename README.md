# Stylelint Plugin Skeleton

This is a basic layout for everything you need to make a stylelint plugin. Written entirely in strict TypeScript.

See [the example rule](https://github.com/electrovir/stylelint-plugin-skeleton/blob/master/src/rules/visibility/visibility.rule.ts) for details.

This uses the [stylelint-rule-creator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylelint-rule-creator) package for extremely succinct rule coding and testing.
